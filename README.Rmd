# EnrichKit

Authors: Lihe Liu and Francisco PeÃ±agaricano  
Maintainer: Lihe Liu (lihe.liu@wisc.edu)


The goal of EnrichKit is to perform an **over-representation analysis** of biological pathways (gene sets) given two gene lists (*Significant Genes* and *Total Genes*) using **Fisher's exact test** (test of proportions based on the hypergeometric distribution). Significant genes could be derived from differentially expressed genes, genes flagged by significant SNPs from whole-genome scans, genes in non-preserved co-expression modules, etc..

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" ", out.width = '400%'}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-Enrich_Illustration.png")

```

**Six pathway/annotation databases** are currently integrated in the current release:

- [Gene Ontology](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/access/biomart)
- [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/)
- [Interpro](http://ensemblgenomes.org/info/access/biomart)
- [MeSH](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C10&q=The+MeSH+translation+maintenance+system%3A+structure%2C+interface+design%2C+and+implementation.&btnG=)
- [Reactome](https://reactome.org/download-data)
- [Molecular Signatures](https://data.broadinstitute.org/gsea-msigdb/msigdb/release/)

Note that the current release only supports **Bos Taurus**, other organisms might be included in the future. 

Latest update 10-08-2020. 

## Installation

EnrichKit is currently unavailable on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).

Users should use the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r ID installation, eval=F}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("liulihe954/EnrichKit") # Depends on R (>= 3.5.0)
```

## Example

Suppose we have identified 2 DEGs from a total of 5 genes in each of two lactations. 

```{r ID convert example}
library(EnrichKit)
# input format
Sig_lac1 =   c("ENSBTAG00000012594","ENSBTAG00000004139")
Sig_lac2 =   c("ENSBTAG00000009188","ENSBTAG00000001258")
Tot_lac1 = c("ENSBTAG00000012594","ENSBTAG00000004139","ENSBTAG00000018278","ENSBTAG00000021997","ENSBTAG00000008482")
Tot_lac2 = c("ENSBTAG00000009188","ENSBTAG00000001258","ENSBTAG00000021819","ENSBTAG00000019404","ENSBTAG00000015212")

# convert and orgnize
GeneInfo = convertNformatID(GeneSetNames=c("lactation1","lactation2"),
                            SigGene_list = list(Sig_lac1,Sig_lac2),
                            TotalGene_list = list(Tot_lac1,Tot_lac2),
                            IDtype = "ens") # Need to choose from c('ens','entrez','symbol')

# Resulting an integreted gene identifier object
GeneInfo
```

Simply providing **significant and total genes** as **lists**, the function ***convertNformatID()** *automatically matches and organizes genes across different identifiers, namely, **Ensembl Gene ID**, **EntrezID**, **Gene Symbol** and **HGNC suggested symbol**. Also, an additional column indicating significance status will be added (1 stands for significant and 0 for insignificant).

The R object resulted from the last step (e.g. **GeneInfo**) could be fed into the subsequent step.   

There are six databases build-in beforehand, users can simply indicate which database they want to use by providing a parameter - **Database = "xxx"** in the function arguments: 

```{r enrich example, eval=F}
# Enrichment of each database might take a few mintues to finish.
HyperGEnrich(GeneSet = GeneInfo,
             Database = 'kegg', #c("go","kegg","interpro","mesh","msig","reactome")
             minOverlap = 4, # minimum overlap of pathway genes and total genes
             pvalue_thres = 0.05, # pvalue of fisher's exact test
             adj_pvalue_thres = 0.1, # adjusted pvalues based on multiple testing correction
             padj_method = "fdr", # c("holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none")
             NewDB = F)
```

This function does not return any object in the R environment, however, all the results are packed into an *.RData* object and saved in the current working directory.

There are two elements in the resulting *.RData* object:  

- **results** contains significant results based on the parameters provided.
- **results_raw** records every single term/pathway tested  

```{r sample results}
# Here is a demo of results format
data(SampleResults)
class(results) # it's a list
length(results) # number of elements equals to numbers of (significant) gene list provided
dim(results[[1]]) # e.g. here are 144 significant pathways/terms and each has 9 attributes/statistics
```

```{r sample results demo}
names(results[[1]]) # Specific attributes/statistics
```
A total of nine columns are documented in the outputs:

- **Term**: term ID and annotation/explanations.
- **totalG**: ***m*** (number of total genes in the pathway)
- **sigG**: ***k*** (number of significant genes in the pathway)
- **pvalue**: Pvalue of Fisher's exact test
- **ExternalLoss_total**: number of total genes **NOT** annotated in the database
- **ExternalLoss_sig**: number of significant genes **NOT** annotated in the database
- **findG**: enumerating **k**, significant genes found in the pathway
- **hitsPerc**: **k/m**, percentage of significant genes
- **adj.pvalue**: adjusted Pvalue (multiple testing correction)

## About Databases

Although databases will be updated on a regular basis (tentatively every 6 months), users are free to request an update or update/download databases using the built-in database updating functions. 

There are a total of six datasets that can be updated.

```{r database update, eval=F}
# Note that these functions are potentially time-comsuming.
# New databases (in .RData format) will be stored in current working directory
GO_DB_Update()
KEGG_DB_Update()
Interpro_DB_Update()
MeSH_DB_Update()
Msig_DB_Update()
Reactome_DB_Update()
```

Please note, when you use new databases, please make sure:  

- Put the new database in your current working directory, it could not be loaded otherwise.  
- Make sure to set *NewDB* parameter to **T**.  

```{r enrich example with new DB,eval=F}
HyperGEnrich(GeneSet = GeneInfo,
             Database = 'kegg', #c("go","kegg","interpro","mesh","msig","reactome")
             minOverlap = 4, # minimum overlap of pathway genes and total genes
             pvalue_thres = 0.05, # pvalue of fisher's exact test
             adj_pvalue_thres = 0.1, # adjusted pvalues based on multiple testing correction
             padj_method = "fdr", #c("holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none")
             NewDB = T) ### Set to T
```
